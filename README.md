# JavaScript: React Evaluation Project

The purpose of this project is to allow us to evaluate your competency with `JavaScript` using React.  Your `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS` knowledge (not just your React) are very valuable to us when we make a decision on a possible future team member.

We would like you to create a mini data visualization app for a JavaScript hero, John David Dalton.  The app has had data prepopulated into it for JDD's GitHub info.

We dont want this to take over your life so work on this for about 4 hours and check in.

## Setup

1. Fork this project
2. Read the `package.json` to see how to run the project
3. The initial redux state is in the app

## Tech we use

- D3 for data visualizations
- CSS and Greensock for animations

## Pre submission

- Add this project to **your** GitHub account and send us... actually go test it again and then send us the link
- Your project must pass the eslint provided in cc-react-scripts

### Remember this is your first impression with us :)

## Good luck and hope to see you soon
